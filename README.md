# BetterPiP Chrome Extension 🌐

## Description 📝

BetterPiP is a Chrome Extension that enables Picture-in-Picture functionality for video elements on any website, even if the feature is originally restricted by the video element.

## Why You Need It? 🤷‍♀️

While Google's own Picture-in-Picture extension works well, it requires you to disable Google Analytics tracking manually and doesn't support some video players. BetterPiP is a non-tracking, more universally applicable alternative.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone this repository 📦
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser 🌐
3. Enable Developer Mode 👩‍💻
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `src` folder of the repository 📂

## How to Use 🤔

Click on the extension icon to activate BetterPiP. The extension will analyze all video elements on the current web page and activate Picture-in-Picture for the largest available video. 🖥️ ➡️ 🔲
